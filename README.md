NVIDIA GameWorks Graphics Samples
====================================================

The GameWorks Graphics Samples pack is a resource for cross-platform Vulkan, OpenGL 4 (GL4) and OpenGL ES 2 and 3 (ES2 and ES3) development, targeting Android and Windows (and soon, will again support Linux x86/x64 and Linux for Tegra).  It is an expansion and continuation of the longstanding OpenGL Graphics and Compute Samples, adding full support for and samples of the Vulkan 3D API.

The samples run on all supported target platforms from a single source base.

Advanced OpenGL features such as Tessellation Shaders, Geometry Shaders, Compute Shaders, Direct State Access, Texture Arrays and Instancing are all demonstrated.  In addition, support for NVIDIA's NSight Tegra Visual Studio plug-in means that developers can experiment with their effects on Windows OpenGL and immediately rebuild and retarget to run on Android Tegra systems, including Tegra K1.

The samples also include source for a simple cross-platform application framework which forms the basis of all of the samples.  This framework supports VK/GL window and context management, platform-independent main event loop, handling of input devices including game controllers, asset/file reading, texture/model loading, and other VK/GL utilities.
